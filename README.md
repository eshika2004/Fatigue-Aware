# Fatigue-Aware
Fatigue-Aware is a smart fatigue detection system designed to monitor a user's alertness in real time using webcam-based facial analysis. The system uses AI techniques and facial landmark tracking (via MediaPipe) to analyze blink rates and eye closure duration, which are key indicators of tiredness, drowsiness, and eye strain.
